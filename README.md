Scholar Enhancer is a Chrome/Firefox extension that enhances your Google Scholar experience. 

It adds some features that may make you happier:
- Expand all publications in a profile with one click (instead of one click for every 20 or 100 items)
- Export all publications into a bibtex or json file.
- Export a list of all publication co-authors.

Get it from [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scholarenhancer/nddafijbmgolhdgmpedfpadenjlemdlc) or [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scholarenhancer/).

Please report any issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/ScholarEnhancer/ScholarEnhancer).
Also, feel free to contribute code to enhance the enhancer! ;)
